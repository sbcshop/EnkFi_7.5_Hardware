The EnkFi series, **powered** by the **ESP32 S3 WROOM**, offers versatile **e-paper display** options in **[2.9”](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_2.9_Hardware), [4.2”](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_4.2_Hardware), [5.83”](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_5.83_Hardware), and [7.5”](https://github.com/sbcshop/EnkFi_7.5_Hardware)** sizes, catering to diverse application needs. These displays feature a wide viewing angle of over 170 degrees and utilize bistable technology, ensuring no power consumption when the screen is not refreshed, making them highly energy-efficient. The black-white-red color scheme protects the eyes by eliminating blue light and radiation. With built-in WiFi and BLE capabilities, the EnkFi series is ideal for IoT-based projects, providing robust connectivity.
